# Extended Transform Editor

WARNING - Might not work with the editor GUI redesign

An extended version of the default Transform editor with no wasted space.

- The scale can be uniformly changed by dragging on the "Scale" label as if it was a float field.
- The position, rotation and scale can all be reset from small buttons to the right of each field.
- You can snap the selected transforms to the ground or set a random rotation from the contex menu.
